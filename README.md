Hi, my name is Nenad. I'm 26 and I want to become Java developer.
I finished my elementary and high school in Serbia.
After that I've moved to Bulgaria where I studied Telecommunucations and Software Engineering at University of Telecommunications and Posts in Sofia.
I have master's degree in IT.
While I was a student, I participated in a European Union project for student internships.
The companies in which I was on student internship are:

- Amdocs
- IOVASOFT 2

Currently I'm working at SuperHosting.BG as a Technical Support Specialist.
At the same time I'm learning Java Programming language at SoftUni.
